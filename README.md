# 🚀 Portfolio Projects – Java Backtesting Engine & Web Development Site

Hi! My name is Omar Torres, I’m a Computer Science student currently pursuing my B.A. and building hands-on projects to strengthen my software development skills. Below are two of my main academic portfolio projects: a **Java trading backtesting engine** and an **interactive multi-section website** developed for my Web Development course.

## 📈 Backtesting Engine (Java)

A full Java-based backtesting sandbox that processes historical daily OHLC data and simulates a 20-day breakout strategy.

### ✅ Features
- Parses daily OHLC CSV rows into fully encapsulated `Bar` objects  
- Identifies long/short signals using 20-day highs/lows with multi-step confirmation  
- Opens trades at next-day open with **gap-aware** stop-loss and profit-target logic  
- Tracks complete trade lifecycle: entry/exit dates, prices, direction, outcome, and holding period  
- Modular OOP design using classes: **Bar**, **Trade**, **SymbolTester**  
- Easy to adjust risk factors, strategy rules, and edge-case handling  
- Designed as a sandbox for experimenting with trade execution behavior
